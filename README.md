# Questions
Your task is complete the implemention so that the unit tests are passing. The idea is to not change the unit tests unless asked to. Normally a class wouldn't be designed like this. This is to assess how you approach a specific problem.

The list of instructions for the assessment is:

1.	Clone Git repository https://github.com/turkzillaGT/Questions.git from Git Hub. You may have to install Git onto your machine to do so.
2.	The code in this repository was developed using .NET 6 in Visual Studio but any suitable IDE should work.
3.	The task is to make changes so that the Unit tests pass. The instructions on what is required is in the SquareRoot and ReadXml classes. 
4.	The AddSquareRootToXml, CalculateSquareRoot and GetXml functions will have to be implemented before the tests will pass.
5.	A small update is also required in the UnitTestQuestions constructor.
6.	Once you are satisfied with your changes upload the solution to your own Git repository. This repository will have to be public so it can be cloned and checked.
7.	Before your interview share the repository details so that the solution can be checked.
